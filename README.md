# Malware-Detection-Using-SLM

This code is use to Detect the malware cases with:
 Very low false-positives on malware detection
 High level of sensitivity in detecting malware. 

If you want to give a shot then, I have provided the code with Real data samples of it. 
This is written in R programming as it was part of my final assignemnt during the Master's Degree Study. 
This program uses Supervised learning Machine Learning algorithms which is based on confusion Matrix to deal with the cases of Malware Samples.
